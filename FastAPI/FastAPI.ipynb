    "## What is FastAPI?\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is a modern web framework for building **high-performance APIs** with Python, leveraging standard web technologies like HTTP and JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **API**: A set of rules that allows applications to communicate over the web using the HTTP protocol to transmit structured data.\n",
    "2. **Web Application**: An application that serves content or services over the internet via web technologies.\n",
    "3. **Web Framework**: A software framework that provides tools and libraries to simplify the development of web applications.\n",

    "## FastAPI Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**FastAPI** is a fast and efficient way to build high-performance APIs using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FastAPI Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).\n",
    "- **Low-code & Easy to Learn**: Uses Python type hints and annotations to make writing APIs feel like writing regular Python functions.\n",
    "- **Robust**: Production-ready, with built-in validation, serialization, and automatic interactive documentation (Swagger UI & ReDoc).\n",
    "- **Standards-based**: Built on top of OpenAPI and JSON Schema standards.\n"
